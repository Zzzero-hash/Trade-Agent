# Model Interpretability and Explainability Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for extending the existing `shap_explainer.py` module to include all required interpretability and explainability features for the AI trading platform.

## Dependencies to Add
The following dependencies need to be added to requirements.txt:
- shap>=0.42.0
- matplotlib>=3.5.0
- seaborn>=0.11.0
- captum>=0.6.0 (for integrated gradients)

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Complete SHAP Explainer Implementation
- Replace dummy SHAP implementation with actual SHAP library integration
- Implement KernelSHAP and DeepSHAP (DeepExplainer) for different use cases
- Add support for ensemble model explanations
- Implement SHAP visualization methods (summary plots, force plots, decision plots)

### 2. Attention Visualization for CNN and LSTM
- Create visualization functions for CNN attention weights
- Create visualization functions for LSTM attention weights
- Implement cross-attention visualization between CNN and LSTM features
- Add heatmap visualizations for attention patterns

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis
- Implement permutation importance calculation
- Add support for multiple scoring metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Create feature importance visualization functions
- Implement comparison between different importance methods

### 4. Integrated Gradients Implementation
- Use Captum library for integrated gradients computation
- Implement integrated gradients for the hybrid CNN+LSTM model
- Add noise tunnel for smoothing attributions
- Create visualization functions for integrated gradients

### 5. Decision Audit Trails
- Implement model version tracking system
- Create audit trail logging for all predictions
- Add feature to track ensemble model weights over time
- Implement performance attribution by model component

### 6. Uncertainty Calibration
- Implement uncertainty calibration methods (Platt scaling, isotonic regression)
- Add confidence score validation functions
- Create reliability diagrams for uncertainty visualization
- Implement metrics for uncertainty quality assessment

### 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for all new interpretability methods
- Add integration tests with the hybrid model
- Create tests for visualization functions
- Implement performance tests for explanation methods

## Module Structure
The extended `shap_explainer.py` module will include:

1. Enhanced SHAPExplainer class with additional methods
2. AttentionVisualization class for attention weight visualization
