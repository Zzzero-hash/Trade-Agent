## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Dependency Compatibility**: Ensure new libraries work with existing PyTorch version
   - Mitigation: Test in isolated environment first

2. **Performance Impact**: Explanation methods may slow down predictions
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and batch processing

3. **Memory Usage**: Visualization libraries may increase memory footprint
   - Mitigation: Implement memory-efficient visualization methods

### Schedule Risks
1. **Complexity Underestimation**: Tasks may take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Build in buffer time and reassess mid-phase

2. **Integration Issues**: New components may not integrate smoothly
   - Mitigation: Use modular design with clear interfaces

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- All required interpretability features implemented
- Integration with existing CNN+LSTM hybrid model
- Compliance with regulatory requirements

### Performance Metrics
- Explanation computation time < 1 second for single predictions
- Memory usage increase < 20% compared to baseline
- Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated explanations

### Quality Metrics

## Rollback Plan

If implementation faces major issues:
1. Revert to original shap_explainer.py with dummy implementation
2. Implement features in separate modules instead of extending existing one
3. Reduce scope to core requirements only
4. Extend timeline by 2 weeks for complex features
