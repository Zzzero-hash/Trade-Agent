# Refactored Distributed Training System

This package provides a modular, maintainable implementation of distributed training capabilities with proper separation of concerns, strategy patterns, and resource management.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- **JobManager**: Handles job queue and lifecycle management
- **WorkerManager**: Manages distributed workers
- **HealthMonitor**: Monitors system health and job timeouts
- **ResourceManager**: Handles resource allocation and cleanup
- **DistributedTrainingOrchestrator**: Coordinates all components

### 2. Strategy Pattern for Model Training
- **ModelTrainingStrategy**: Abstract base class for training strategies
- **CNNTrainingStrategy**: CNN model training implementation
- **HybridTrainingStrategy**: Hybrid CNN+LSTM model training implementation
- **RLTrainingStrategy**: Reinforcement Learning model training implementation
- **TrainingStrategyFactory**: Factory for creating training strategies

### 3. Proper Exception Handling
- Comprehensive exception hierarchy with specific error types
- Automatic error logging and context management
- Recoverable error identification

### 4. Resource Management
- Context manager for Ray cluster lifecycle
- Proper resource cleanup with try/finally patterns
- Graceful degradation when Ray is not available

### 5. Thread Safety
- Fine-grained locking for job management
- Thread-safe data structures
- Proper synchronization between components

## Usage Example

```python
from src.ml.refactored_distributed_training import (
    DistributedTrainingConfig,
    create_distributed_training_system
)

# Create configuration
config = DistributedTrainingConfig(
    num_workers=4,
    cpus_per_worker=2,
    gpus_per_worker=0.25
)

# Create and start system
orchestrator = create_distributed_training_system(config)
orchestrator.start_training_workers()

# Submit training jobs
job_id = orchestrator.submit_training_job(
    model_type="cnn",
    config={
        "input_dim": 100,
        "output_dim": 10,
        "features": features_data,
        "targets": targets_data
    },
    priority=1
)

# Wait for completion
results = orchestrator.wait_for_completion([job_id])

# Shutdown system
orchestrator.shutdown()
```
