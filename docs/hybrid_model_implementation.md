# CNN+LSTM Hybrid Model Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the CNN+LSTM hybrid model as specified in task 8 of the AI trading platform. This model integrates CNN feature extraction with LSTM temporal processing for multi-task learning with ensemble capabilities and uncertainty quantification.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. CNN+LSTM Integration ✅
- **CNNFeatureExtractor**: Extracts spatial patterns from multi-dimensional market data using multiple filter sizes (3, 5, 7, 11) with attention mechanisms
- **LSTMTemporalProcessor**: Processes temporal sequences with bidirectional LSTM, attention, and skip connections
- **FeatureFusion**: Cross-attention mechanism that combines CNN and LSTM features effectively

### 2. Multi-task Learning ✅
- **Classification Head**: Predicts trading signals (Buy/Hold/Sell) using softmax output
- **Regression Head**: Predicts future prices with uncertainty quantification using Monte Carlo dropout
- **Weighted Loss Function**: Combines classification and regression losses with configurable weights

### 3. Ensemble Capabilities ✅
- **Multiple Ensemble Models**: 5 independent models by default for robust predictions
- **Learnable Ensemble Weights**: Automatically optimized weights for combining ensemble predictions
- **Ensemble Averaging**: Weighted combination of predictions from multiple models

### 4. Uncertainty Quantification ✅
- **Monte Carlo Dropout**: Uses dropout during inference to estimate prediction uncertainty
- **Uncertainty Calibration**: Provides confidence intervals for regression predictions
- **Epistemic Uncertainty**: Captures model uncertainty through ensemble variance
