### Multi-Objective Optimization

The system optimizes three key objectives simultaneously:

1. **Classification Accuracy** (maximize)
   - Primary performance metric
   - Measured on validation set

2. **Training Time** (minimize)
   - Wall-clock time for model training
   - Ensures practical deployment feasibility

3. **Model Size** (minimize)
   - Memory footprint in MB
   - Important for resource-constrained environments

### Early Pruning Strategy

Two pruning strategies are implemented:

1. **HyperbandPruner** (default)
   - Successive halving algorithm
   - Dynamically allocates resources
   - Reduction factor of 3

2. **MedianPruner**
   - Prunes trials below median performance
   - Configurable warmup steps
