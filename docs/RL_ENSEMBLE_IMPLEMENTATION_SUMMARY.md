**Key Features**:

- Beta distribution-based sampling for agent weights
- Dynamic weight adjustment based on reward feedback
- Convergence to better-performing agents over time
- Statistical tracking and reporting

**Implementation Highlights**:

- Uses Beta(α, β) distributions for each agent
- Updates α on positive rewards, β on negative rewards
- Normalizes sampled weights to sum to 1
- Maintains reward history for analysis

### 2. Meta-Learning Network (`MetaLearner`)

**Purpose**: Neural network that learns optimal ensemble weights based on state features and agent performance.

**Key Features**:

- PyTorch-based neural network architecture
- Takes state features and agent performance as input
- Outputs normalized ensemble weights via softmax
- Learns from experience with reward-weighted loss

**Architecture**:

- Input: state_dim + n_agents \* 2 (state + 2 features per agent)
- Hidden layers: 64 units with ReLU activation
- Output: n_agents weights with softmax normalization

### 3. Ensemble Manager (`EnsembleManager`)

**Purpose**: Central coordinator that manages multiple RL agents with dynamic weight adjustment.

**Key Features**:

- Manages collection of RL agents
- Combines Thompson sampling and meta-learning
- Weighted ensemble predictions
- Performance tracking and statistics
- Model saving/loading capabilities

**Core Functionality**:

- **Prediction**: Weighted average of individual agent actions
- **Weight Updates**: Combines Thompson sampling and meta-learning
- **Performance Tracking**: Maintains reward history and statistics
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive ensemble performance assessment

### 4. Ensemble Factory (`EnsembleFactory`)

**Purpose**: Factory pattern for creating pre-configured ensemble setups.

**Key Features**:

- Standard ensemble creation (PPO, SAC, TD3, DQN)
- Custom ensemble configuration
- Automatic agent type selection based on action space
- Flexible configuration options

## Technical Implementation Details

### Thompson Sampling Algorithm

```python
# Sample weights from Beta distributions
weights = [np.random.beta(α_i, β_i) for i in range(n_agents)]
weights = weights / sum(weights)  # Normalize

# Update based on reward feedback
if reward > baseline:
    α_i += 1  # Success
else:
    β_i += 1  # Failure
```

### Meta-Learning Architecture

```python
# Network forward pass
input_features = concat([state_features, agent_features])
hidden = ReLU(Linear(input_features))
hidden = ReLU(Linear(hidden))
weights = Softmax(Linear(hidden))
```

### Ensemble Prediction

```python
# Get individual predictions
individual_actions = [agent.predict(obs) for agent in agents]

# Compute weighted ensemble
ensemble_action = np.average(individual_actions, weights=weights)
```
