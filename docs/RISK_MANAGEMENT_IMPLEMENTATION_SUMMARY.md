   - Concentration risk: 0.449 (detected high concentration)

2. **Risk Limit Enforcement:**
   - Detected concentration limit breach (44.9% > 40%)
   - Generated VaR warning (above $3,000 threshold)

3. **Position Sizing:**
   - Reduced NVDA position from 25% to 5.7% due to high volatility
   - Applied correlation penalties and volatility targeting

4. **Stress Testing:**
   - 2008 crash scenario: -13.3% portfolio loss
   - COVID-19 scenario: -11.8% portfolio loss
