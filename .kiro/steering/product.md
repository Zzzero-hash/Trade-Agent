# Product Overview

## ML Trading Ensemble

End-to-End Machine Learning Trading System using Real Market Data from yfinance.

This is a practical, production-ready machine learning project focused on developing high-performance models for financial market prediction and trading using real market data. The system combines CNN+LSTM architectures for feature extraction with reinforcement learning agents, trained and validated on actual stock market data from yfinance.

## Key Components

- **yfinance Data Pipeline**: Real-time and historical market data ingestion from 100+ liquid stocks
- **CNN+LSTM Feature Extractors**: Multi-timeframe feature extraction from OHLCV data with 200+ technical indicators
- **RL Agent Ensemble**: Reinforcement learning agents trained on realistic market environments with transaction costs
- **End-to-End Inference System**: Complete pipeline from live data to trading signals with <100ms latency
- **Realistic Backtesting Framework**: Comprehensive evaluation with proper temporal splits and transaction costs

## Performance Goals

The project aims to achieve practical trading performance with:
- Sharpe ratios >1.5 with maximum drawdowns <15% on real market data
- Outperform buy-and-hold and technical analysis baselines with statistical significance
- Maintain consistent performance across different market regimes (2020 COVID crash, recovery periods)
- Generate actionable trading signals on live market data

## Project Focus

This is an end-to-end ML project that prioritizes:
- **Real Data Integration**: Using actual market data from yfinance for training and evaluation
- **Production Readiness**: Complete inference pipeline for live trading decisions
- **Practical Performance**: Realistic evaluation with transaction costs and proper backtesting
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic results with version-controlled data and models
- **Deployment Focus**: Ready-to-use system with monitoring and maintenance capabilities
