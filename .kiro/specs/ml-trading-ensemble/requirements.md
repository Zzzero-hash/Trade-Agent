## Introduction

This project focuses exclusively on developing the most advanced and highest-performing machine learning models for financial market prediction and decision-making. The goal is to create state-of-the-art CNN+LSTM feature extractors and ensemble RL agents that represent the pinnacle of financial ML research and engineering. Every aspect of model development, from architecture design to training techniques to evaluation frameworks, must achieve research-grade excellence and production-level robustness. A key element of this design focuses on using CNN+LSTM features to provide an enriched environment to the ensemble of RL agents.
