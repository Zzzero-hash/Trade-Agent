- **Ensemble Disagreement**: Use confidence-weighted voting and fallback to conservative actions

### System-Level Errors

- **Memory Management**: Use efficient data structures and implement garbage collection for old experiences
- **Model Versioning**: Maintain model registries with rollback capabilities
