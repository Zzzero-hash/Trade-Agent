# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Trading Platform is an intelligent trading system that combines machine learning and reinforcement learning to provide automated trading decisions across multiple asset classes. The platform integrates data from multiple exchanges (Robinhood for equities, OANDA for forex, Coinbase for crypto), processes this data through CNN+LSTM hybrid models and RL ensembles, and delivers trading signals through a FastAPI backend with a Next.js dashboard interface.

The system serves both individual traders and institutional clients by providing real-time market analysis, risk management, portfolio optimization, and explainable AI-driven trading recommendations with comprehensive monitoring and compliance features.
