# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered trading platform that democratizes machine learning and artificial intelligence for traders. The platform combines state-of-the-art CNN+LSTM models for feature extraction and target prediction with ensemble reinforcement learning models for trading decisions.
