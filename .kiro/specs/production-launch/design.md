# Production Launch Design Document

## Overview

The production launch design transforms the existing AI Trading Platform from a development system into a commercially viable, enterprise-grade financial services platform. This involves implementing production infrastructure following AWS Well-Architected principles, establishing regulatory compliance frameworks, integrating real money trading capabilities, and creating scalable business operations.

The design emphasizes reliability, security, compliance, and customer success while maintaining the core AI-driven trading capabilities that differentiate the platform.
